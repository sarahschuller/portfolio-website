                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>myFlix is a web application that was created using the MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js tech stack, or MERN. This application provides users with information about a variety of movies, along with details about the movie director and genre. Users can register, sign-in, update their personal information and add movies to their favorites list.</p>

              <div class="purpose">
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>This project was part of my Full Stack Development course at Career Foundry. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my understanding of the MERN tech stack and provide me with further experience working in Javascript development.</p>
                <br><br>

              <div class="objective">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to have a fully functional full-stack project to include with my portfolio. I needed to learn how to build the server-side and client-side of the application from scratch to deliver a finished product.</p>
                <br><br>

              <div class="approach">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                <p>The server-side of this project was built using Node.JS, Express and MongoDB. I created an API that can be called using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The endpoints created were tested using Postman. Information provided by the API is delivered in JSON format</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Client-Side</h3>
                <p>The client-side of this project was built using React, React-Redux and React Bootstrap. The app is comprised of a single page that is able to switch between multiple views (the user profile, login and registration forms, single movie details, Director details, etc.)</p>
                <br><br>
              </div>

              <div class="challenges">
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>This was a satisfying project to complete but was not without its challenges. Learning React and understanding how to properly route the application were my biggest hurdles but were overcome with the help and knowledge of my tutor and mentor. </p>
